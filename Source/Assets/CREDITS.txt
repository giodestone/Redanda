This game was made as a late Ludum Dare entry. The theme was Combine 2 Incompatible Genres and we decided intially to combine snakes and ladders with a shooter (tabletop + shooter) but none of us have multiplayer programming skills, as the whole thing would have to be networked or split screen.

So we settled for the shooting typing idea which made you type if you wanted to reload or do some actions. In the end just got the typing done.

Initially it was supposed to be a red panda that was going to shoot things (inspired by pusheen) but then changed to a pineapple... for some reason (ask the artist). Same with the doughnuts.

All sfx was used creting foiley. paper tearing, keystorkes, writing on paper, spraying detol in a cup. Mic used was a blue yeti snowball.

Its good game :)

Finished on time with only one known bug: no death sound is played.
